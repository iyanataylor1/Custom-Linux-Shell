# Custom-Linux-Shell

Our Custom Shell Project is a user-centric program designed to mirror the functionality 
of standard Unix/Linux shells while being simple and practical. Itâ€™s developed in C for a Linux 
environment and this shell supports essential file system operations to manipulate files and 
directories, environment variable handling is also included. Key features include creating, 
renaming, and deleting files, making, changing and removing directories, managing file 
permissions, and setting and retrieving environment variables. The shell also includes a helpful 
command reference menu (help) for user guidance and employs robust error handling to manage 
invalid inputs and unforeseen issues effectively, at almost every step of the code.
Modularity is used extensively throughout the code, with functions clearly defined for 
each operation to ensure readability and ease of maintenance. Error messages are descriptive, 
aiming to provide immediate feedback and suggestions for user correction.
The point of this shell is to help get a deeper understanding and hands-on experience with 
core operating system principles, like system calls, process control, and file system interactions
and to explore the mechanics behind modern command-line interfaces.

This project is not hosted via a third party, the source code must be downloaded, compile and run locally.
The code was written for Linux specifically, it may not work for other OS terminals. Set up instructions are in the PDF in the repo.
